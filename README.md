# Set Up

In order to run the MuJoCo simulation, it's best to create a virtual environment and then install everything you need.

1.) Run "python3 -m venv venv" in the terminal to create a venv.
2.) Run "source venv/bin/activate" to use the venv you just created.
3.) Then, install any packages you need, for instance, you probably need to install mujoco if you haven't already.
4.) Finally, start the mujoco simulation by running "python3 Run_RapidReachingEnv.py".
