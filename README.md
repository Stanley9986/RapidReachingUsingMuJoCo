# Set Up

In order to run the MuJoCo simulation, it's best to create a virtual environment and then install everything you need. <br><br>

1.) Run "python3 -m venv venv" in the terminal to create a venv. <br>
2.) Run "source venv/bin/activate" to use the venv you just created. <br>
3.) Then, install any packages you need, for instance, you probably need to install mujoco if you haven't already. <br>
4.) Finally, start the mujoco simulation by running "python3 Run_RapidReachingEnv.py".
